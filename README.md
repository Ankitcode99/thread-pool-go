1. Channel Operations and Goroutine Scheduling

    When a goroutine performs a channel operation (send or receive) that cannot complete immediately, the Go runtime automatically handles the suspension and resumption of the goroutine. This is part of Go's built-in concurrency model.

```
for job := range pool.jobQueue {
    job(workerID)
}
```

2. Blocking Channel Operations
```
In this loop, <-pool.jobQueue is a receive operation on the channel. If the channel is empty, this operation cannot complete immediately.
```    

3. Goroutine Suspension
When the runtime encounters this blocking operation:
    - It marks the current goroutine as waiting.
    - It removes the goroutine from the processor it's running on.
    - It switches to running another goroutine that's ready to execute.

4. Runtime Scheduler
Go's runtime scheduler manages this process. It keeps track of:
    - Goroutines that are ready to run
    - Goroutines that are waiting on channel operations, system calls, etc.

5. Channel Send Operation
When another goroutine sends a value on the channel:
    - The runtime marks the waiting goroutine as runnable.
    - The scheduler will eventually resume this goroutine on an available processor.

6. Efficiency

    This suspension doesn't use busy-waiting or spinning. The goroutine consumes no CPU cycles while waiting, making it very efficient.

7. Implementation Details
The actual implementation involves complex interactions between the Go runtime, the operating system scheduler, and hardware-specific details. The Go runtime uses techniques like:
    - Work-stealing schedulers
    - Processor-local run queues
    - Global run queues
